Shades of Amber
===============
*Amber monitor influenced, nostalgic colour scheme*

Script Type
-----------
color scheme (vim)
 
Description
-----------

At college (way back when), whenever I was given the choice, I would choose
the amber terminal over the green one every time. It's easy on the eye, and somehow “cooler”.

Anyway, here's my stab at reproducing the experience (with a broader palette of oranges).
And it's in constant daily use. Hope you like it.
